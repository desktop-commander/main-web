# Legacy URL Redirects
# Redirect old ID-based URLs to new slug-based URLs
# Format: /old-path /new-path 301

# Old subdomain redirects (if library.desktopcommander.app was used)
# These handle the URLs shown in Google Search Console
https://library.desktopcommander.app/* https://desktopcommander.app/library/:splat 301

# Individual ID-based redirects (if you have specific ones Google is flagging)
# You would need to add these manually for each ID â†’ slug mapping
# Example:
# /library/prompts?i=5 /library/prompts/convert-heic-to-png/ 301
# /library/?i=32 /library/prompts/[appropriate-slug]/ 301

# Note: The client-side redirect in Prompts.tsx will handle most cases
# These server-side redirects are backup and for SEO juice preservation
