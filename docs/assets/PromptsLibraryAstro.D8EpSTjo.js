This prevents context overload while managing complex feature development efficiently.\\n\\n**Important**: Maximum 3 phases keeps this manageable. Each phase delivers significant development value while building toward the complete feature.\\n\\n## Desktop Commander Integration\\n- **Codebase Analysis**: Systematically analyze existing project structure and patterns before implementing\\n- **File Creation & Management**: Create all necessary files with proper organization and naming\\n- **Multi-Chat Continuity**: Progress tracking enables development work across multiple sessions\\n- **Code Integration**: Seamlessly integrate new code with existing architecture and patterns\\n- **Testing & Validation**: Run tests and verify feature functionality as development progresses\\n\\n## Initial Setup & Context Gathering\\n\\n**⚠️ Note: The questions below are optional but recommended. Answering them will significantly improve the quality and relevance of your feature implementation. If you prefer to start immediately with default settings, just say \\"use defaults\\" or \\"skip questions\\" and I\'ll begin with sensible assumptions.**\\n\\nBefore I begin executing feature development, providing the following information will help me customize the approach to your specific project:\\n\\n### Essential Context Questions (Optional - Improves Results)\\n1. **What feature do you want to build?** - Determines implementation approach and complexity\\n2. **What\'s the full path to your project root directory?** - Required for analyzing existing code and creating files\\n3. **What\'s your project\'s main technology stack?** - Affects coding patterns, file structure, and integration approach\\n4. **How familiar are you with the existing codebase?** - Influences explanation detail and integration strategy\\n\\n### Project Context (Optional - Customizes Output)\\n- **Feature complexity**: Simple component, full user flow, or complex system integration?\\n- **User requirements**: Who will use this feature and how should it behave?\\n- **Existing patterns**: Are there similar features I should model this after?\\n\\n### Technical Context (Optional - Enhances Accuracy)\\n- **Architecture style**: Component-based, MVC, microservices, monolithic?\\n- **Testing approach**: Unit tests, integration tests, or specific testing framework?\\n- **Code standards**: Linting rules, naming conventions, or style guides?\\n\\n### Execution Preferences (Optional - Controls Output)\\n- **Working directory**: Where should feature files be created? (Default: follow existing project structure)\\n- **Implementation style**: Minimal viable feature or comprehensive solution with error handling?\\n- **Integration approach**: Replace existing functionality or add alongside current features?\\n\\n**Quick Start Options:**\\n- **Provide context**: Answer the questions above for customized implementation\\n- **Use defaults**: Say \\"use defaults\\" and I\'ll start with standard development patterns\\n- **Skip to Phase 1**: Say \\"begin immediately\\" to start analysis and design\\n\\nOnce you provide context (or choose defaults), I\'ll create the initial development directory and progress tracking files, then begin Phase 1 of the streamlined feature development process.\\n\\n## Core Development Framework\\n\\n### Feature Types Supported\\n- **User Interface Components**: Forms, dashboards, interactive elements, responsive layouts\\n- **API Endpoints**: REST APIs, GraphQL resolvers, data processing endpoints\\n- **Database Features**: Models, migrations, queries, data relationships\\n- **Business Logic**: Algorithms, workflows, data processing, automation\\n- **Integration Features**: Third-party APIs, webhooks, external service connections\\n\\n### Technology Stack Support\\n- **Frontend**: React, Vue.js, Angular, vanilla JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML/CSS\\n- **Backend**: Node.js, Python (Django/Flask), PHP, Java, C#, Ruby on Rails\\n- **Databases**: SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL), NoSQL (MongoDB, Redis)\\n- **Mobile**: React Native, Flutter, native iOS/Android development\\n\\n## File Organization System\\n\\n### Simple Directory Structure\\n```\\n/[feature-name]/\\n├── components/\\n│   ├── [FeatureComponent].js\\n│   └── [FeatureComponent].css\\n├── services/\\n│   └── [feature-service].js\\n├── tests/\\n│   └── [feature].test.js\\n├── docs/\\n│   └── [feature]-implementation.md\\n└── feature-development-progress.md\\n```\\n\\n### Simple Naming\\n- **Component files**: `[FeatureName]Component.[ext]`\\n- **Service files**: `[feature-name]-service.[ext]`\\n- **All feature code in organized structure** - follows existing project patterns\\n\\n## Quality Standards\\n\\n### Development Requirements\\n- Code follows existing project patterns and conventions\\n- Proper error handling and input validation implemented\\n- Integration respects existing architecture and data flow\\n- Clear documentation for feature usage and maintenance\\n\\n### Code Quality Standards\\n- **Consistency**: Match existing code style, naming conventions, and architecture patterns\\n- **Functionality**: Feature works as specified with proper error handling\\n- **Integration**: Seamless integration with existing codebase without breaking changes\\n- **Maintainability**: Clean, readable code with appropriate comments and documentation\\n\\n## Feature Development Execution Command\\n\\nOnce configured, start each development cycle with:\\n\\n**\\"Begin feature development.

This prevents running out of chat limits and ensures thorough validation at each step.\\n\\n**Important**: I will NOT try to migrate everything at once. Each phase is deliberately limited to avoid context overload and reduce migration risk.\\n\\n## Desktop Commander Integration\\n- **Local Codebase Analysis**: Directly analyze your project files, configurations, and dependencies on your system\\n- **Backup Management**: Create systematic backups before making changes, with clear restore procedures\\n- **Phase-Limited File Updates**: Modify files in controlled batches to avoid overwhelming context and enable validation\\n- **Migration Documentation**: Generate comprehensive migration logs and issue tracking locally\\n- **Progressive Migration**: Build updated codebase incrementally with validation at each phase\\n- **Local Development Environment**: All changes made directly in your development environment with proper phase documentation\\n\\n## Initial Setup & Context Gathering\\n\\nBefore I begin executing this technology migration, I need to understand your specific requirements and context. Please provide the following information:\\n\\n### Essential Context Questions\\n1. **What is the current technology/framework version and what version are you migrating to?** - This determines migration complexity and compatibility requirements\\n2. **Where is your project located on your system?** - I need the absolute path to analyze your codebase\\n3. **What type of application is this?** - Web app, mobile app, API, library, etc. affects migration approach\\n4. **How critical is this application?** - Affects backup strategy and risk tolerance\\n\\n### Project Context\\n- **Development team size**: Are you working solo or with a team? (affects coordination needs)\\n- **Production environment**: Is this currently deployed? (determines rollback requirements)\\n- **Testing coverage**: Do you have existing tests? (affects validation strategy)\\n\\n### Technical Context  \\n- **Dependencies and integrations**: What external libraries, APIs, or services does your app use?\\n- **Custom configurations**: Any custom build processes, deployment scripts, or environment setups?\\n- **Known issues**: Any existing bugs or compatibility problems with the current version?\\n\\n### Execution Preferences\\n- **Working directory**: Where is your project located? (I\'ll analyze from this path)\\n- **Backup location**: Where should I create migration backups? (Default: project-root/migration-backups/)\\n- **Risk tolerance**: Do you prefer conservative (extensive backups) or aggressive (faster) migration approach?\\n- **Timeline constraints**: Any deadlines or staging requirements that affect the migration schedule?\\n\\nOnce you provide this context, I\'ll create the initial migration assessment and progress tracking files, then begin Phase 1 of the migration process.\\n\\n## Core Migration Framework\\n\\n### Migration Strategy Development\\n- **Compatibility Matrix**: Document current vs. target version compatibility for all dependencies\\n- **Risk Assessment**: Identify high-risk changes and potential breaking changes\\n- **Rollback Plan**: Clear procedures to revert changes if migration fails\\n- **Testing Strategy**: How to validate each migration step\\n\\n### Change Management Process\\n- **Incremental Updates**: Small, testable changes rather than large rewrites\\n- **Version Control Integration**: Proper commit strategy for tracking migration progress  \\n- **Dependency Management**: Update package managers and resolve version conflicts\\n- **Configuration Migration**: Update config files, environment variables, and deployment scripts\\n\\n### Validation Protocols\\n- **Build Verification**: Ensure project builds successfully after each phase\\n- **Functionality Testing**: Validate core features work as expected\\n- **Performance Baseline**: Compare pre/post migration performance\\n- **Integration Testing**: Verify external dependencies and APIs still function\\n\\n## File Organization System\\n\\n### Simple Migration Structure\\n```\\n/[Project-Root]/\\n├── migration-backups/\\n│   ├── pre-migration-full-backup/\\n│   ├── phase-1-backup/\\n│   └── phase-2-backup/\\n├── migration-logs/\\n│   ├── assessment-report.md\\n│   ├── migration-plan.md\\n│   └── issue-tracking.md\\n├── [your existing project files]\\n└── migration-progress.md\\n```\\n\\n### Simple Documentation\\n- **Assessment report**: `assessment-[date].md` - Initial codebase analysis\\n- **Migration plan**: `migration-plan-[technology].md` - Step-by-step strategy  \\n- **Issue tracking**: `migration-issues-[date].md` - Problems encountered and solutions\\n- **All migration documentation in easily searchable files** - no complex folder structures\\n\\n## Scope Management Philosophy\\n\\n### Start Minimal, Add Complexity Only When Requested\\n- **Phase 1**: Focus on core migration requirements with minimal viable changes\\n- **Default approach**: Conservative migration that maintains existing functionality\\n- **Complexity additions**: Only when user specifically requests advanced features or optimizations\\n- **Feature creep prevention**: Ask before adding \\"nice-to-have\\" improvements during migration\\n\\n### Progressive Enhancement Strategy\\n- **Core first**: Get basic technology migration working perfectly\\n- **User-driven additions**: Let user request code improvements after successful migration\\n- **Avoid assumptions**: Don\'t add optimizations \\"because they might be useful\\"\\n- **Validate need**: Ask \\"Do you need [code improvements] or is the basic migration sufficient?\\"\\n\\n### Scope Control Questions\\nBefore adding complexity, I\'ll ask:\\n- \\"The basic migration covers version compatibility. Do you need code optimizations too?\\"\\n- \\"Should I keep this as a simple version upgrade or add [specific modernization features]?\\"\\n- \\"This handles the core migration requirements. What additional improvements would be helpful?\\"\\n\\n## Safety & Confirmation Protocol\\n\\n### Before Major Changes, I Will:\\n- **Create comprehensive backups** before starting any migration phase\\n- **Confirm destructive operations** before modifying or replacing existing files\\n- **Validate migration steps** by testing builds and functionality after each phase\\n- **Document rollback procedures** for each change made during migration\\n\\n### Confirmation Required For:\\n- **File modifications**: \\"This will update [X files] with new syntax. Confirm: Yes/No?\\"\\n- **Dependency changes**: \\"This will upgrade [X packages] which may affect functionality. Confirm: Yes/No?\\"\\n- **Configuration updates**: \\"This will replace your existing [config files]. Confirm: Yes/No?\\"\\n- **Large code refactoring**: \\"This will restructure [component] for new version compatibility. Confirm: Yes/No?\\"\\n\\n### Safety-First Approach:\\n- **Backup everything**: Full project backup before starting, phase backups during migration\\n- **Incremental validation**: Test functionality after each change before proceeding\\n- **Clear warnings**: \\"⚠️ WARNING: This change may break [specific functionality]\\"\\n- **Recovery information**: Always explain how to restore from backups if needed\\n\\n## Migration Quality Standards\\n\\n### Technical Requirements\\n- **Backward compatibility**: Maintain existing functionality unless explicitly changing it\\n- **Dependency resolution**: All package conflicts resolved and tested\\n- **Build success**: Project must build successfully after each phase\\n- **Performance maintenance**: No significant performance degradation\\n\\n### Documentation Standards\\n- **Change tracking**: Document every modification made during migration\\n- **Issue resolution**: Record problems encountered and solutions implemented\\n- **Testing results**: Log all validation steps and their outcomes\\n- **Rollback procedures**: Clear instructions for reverting changes if needed\\n\\n### Migration Validation\\n- **Automated testing**: Run existing test suites after each migration phase\\n- **Manual verification**: Test core application functionality\\n- **Integration testing**: Verify external dependencies and APIs work correctly\\n- **Performance benchmarking**: Compare before/after metrics\\n\\n## Getting Started\\n\\n### Migration Execution Command\\n\\nOnce configured, start each migration phase with:\\n\\n**\\"Begin technology migration.

Please provide the following information:\\n\\n### Essential Context Questions\\n1. **What is the project path/directory?** - This determines where I\'ll analyze code and create test files\\n2. **What programming language and testing framework are you using?** - Affects test file structure and syntax\\n3. **Do you have existing tests I should analyze first?** - Helps me understand current coverage and patterns\\n4. **What types of testing are most important?** - Unit tests, integration tests, or specific testing priorities\\n\\n### Project Context\\n- **Project type**: Web application, library, CLI tool, mobile app, etc.\\n- **Codebase size**: Small project (<50 files), medium (50-200 files), or large (200+ files)\\n- **Testing maturity**: No tests, basic tests, or established testing practices\\n\\n### Technical Context  \\n- **Testing framework preferences**: Jest, pytest, JUnit, RSpec, Mocha, etc.\\n- **Test organization**: Where should tests be located relative to source files?\\n- **Mocking/stubbing requirements**: Do you need mocks for external dependencies?\\n- **Coverage standards**: What level of coverage are you targeting?\\n\\n### Quality Standards Context\\n- **Test naming conventions**: Any specific patterns you follow?\\n- **Test structure preferences**: Arrange-Act-Assert, Given-When-Then, etc.\\n- **Code quality standards**: Linting, formatting, or style requirements for tests\\n- **CI/CD integration**: Do tests need to work with specific build tools?\\n\\n### Execution Preferences\\n- **Working directory**: What\'s the full path to your project? \\n- **Priority modules**: Are there specific files/modules you want tested first?\\n- **Timeline/scope**: Should I focus on critical modules or aim for comprehensive coverage?\\n\\nOnce you provide this context, I\'ll create the initial configuration and progress tracking files, then begin Phase 1 of the test coverage analysis process.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Core Test Coverage Framework\\n\\n### Systematic Analysis Approach\\n1. **Module Discovery**: Use Desktop Commander to scan all source files\\n2. **Existing Test Mapping**: Identify current test files and coverage patterns  \\n3. **Gap Analysis**: Compare source modules against test coverage\\n4. **Complexity Assessment**: Evaluate testing difficulty and requirements for each module\\n5. **Test Generation**: Create comprehensive test files with multiple test cases\\n6. **Quality Validation**: Ensure tests follow best practices and cover edge cases\\n\\n### Test File Generation Standards\\n- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Test all public methods, edge cases, and error conditions\\n- **Clear Test Structure**: Organized with descriptive names and logical groupings\\n- **Mock Integration**: Properly mock external dependencies and services\\n- **Documentation**: Include comments explaining complex test scenarios\\n- **Maintainability**: Write tests that are easy to update as code changes\\n\\n---\\n\\n## File Organization System\\n\\n### Simple Directory Structure\\n```\\n/[Project-Root]/\\n├── [existing source files]\\n├── [existing test directories]\\n├── test-coverage-analysis/\\n│   ├── coverage-report.md\\n│   ├── test-coverage-progress.md\\n│   └── generated-tests/\\n│       ├── [Module1]Test.[ext]\\n│       ├── [Module2]Test.[ext]\\n│       └── [Module3]Test.[ext]\\n```\\n\\n### Simple Naming\\n- **Coverage report**: `coverage-report-[date].md`\\n- **Test files**: Follow project\'s existing naming conventions\\n- **Progress tracking**: `test-coverage-progress.md`\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Quality Standards\\n\\n### Test Coverage Requirements\\n- **Method Coverage**: All public methods must have test cases\\n- **Edge Case Testing**: Boundary conditions, null/empty inputs, error scenarios\\n- **Integration Points**: Test interactions between modules and external dependencies\\n- **Error Handling**: Verify proper exception handling and error messages\\n\\n### Test Code Quality Standards\\n- **Readability**: Clear, descriptive test names and structure\\n- **Independence**: Each test should be able to run independently\\n- **Repeatability**: Tests produce consistent results across runs\\n- **Fast Execution**: Optimize for quick test suite execution\\n- **Maintenance**: Easy to update when source code changes\\n\\n### Framework-Specific Standards\\n- **Assertions**: Use appropriate assertion methods for the testing framework\\n- **Setup/Teardown**: Proper test lifecycle management\\n- **Grouping**: Logical organization of related test cases\\n- **Documentation**: Comments explaining complex test logic\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Scope Management Philosophy\\n\\n### Start Minimal, Add Complexity Only When Requested\\n- **Phase 1**: Focus on critical modules with basic test coverage\\n- **Default approach**: Standard unit tests for core functionality\\n- **Complexity additions**: Only add integration tests, performance tests, or advanced mocking when specifically requested\\n- **Feature creep prevention**: Ask before adding comprehensive test utilities or complex test infrastructure\\n\\n### Progressive Enhancement Strategy\\n- **Core functionality first**: Get basic test coverage working for essential modules\\n- **User-driven additions**: Let user request additional test types after seeing core test files\\n- **Avoid assumptions**: Don\'t add advanced testing features \\"because they might be useful\\"\\n- **Validate need**: Ask \\"Do you need [integration tests/performance tests] or is basic unit testing sufficient?\\"\\n\\n### Scope Control Questions\\nBefore adding complexity, I\'ll ask:\\n- \\"The basic test coverage handles your core functionality. Do you need additional test types?\\"\\n- \\"Should I keep this focused on unit tests or add integration testing?\\"\\n- \\"This covers your main use cases. What other testing scenarios would be helpful?\\"\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Safety & Confirmation Protocol\\n\\n### Before Major Changes, I Will:\\n- **Ask for confirmation** before creating many test files at once\\n- **Warn about overwrites** when test files with similar names already exist\\n- **Confirm directory creation** before adding new test directories\\n- **Preview test structure** for complex modules before generating full test files\\n\\n### Confirmation Required For:\\n- **Bulk test generation**: \\"This will create [X] test files in [directory]. Confirm: Yes/No?\\"\\n- **Directory creation**: \\"This will create test directories at [paths]. Confirm: Yes/No?\\"\\n- **Existing test modification**: \\"This will update existing test file [filename]. Confirm: Yes/No?\\"\\n- **Framework changes**: \\"This will set up [testing framework] configuration. Confirm: Yes/No?\\"\\n\\n### Safety-First Approach:\\n- **Default to non-destructive**: Create new test files rather than modifying existing ones\\n- **Incremental generation**: Create a few test files at a time rather than bulk generation\\n- **Clear warnings**: \\"⚠️ WARNING: This will create [X] new files in your project\\"\\n- **Backup information**: Always explain how to remove generated files if needed\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Getting Started\\n\\nAfter providing the context above, I\'ll:\\n\\n1. **Create Progress File**: Initialize `test-coverage-progress.md` with your project details\\n2. **Analyze Project Structure**: Scan your codebase to understand the module organization\\n3. **Map Existing Tests**: Identify current test coverage patterns\\n4. **Generate Coverage Report**: Create initial analysis of testing gaps\\n5. **Begin Test Generation**: Start creating test files for priority modules\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Test Coverage Execution Command\\n\\nOnce configured, start each test coverage session with:\\n\\n**\\"Begin test coverage analysis.
