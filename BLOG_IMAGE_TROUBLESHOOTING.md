# Blog Image Troubleshooting Summary

## Session Date
October 6, 2025

## Initial Problem
Blog section images were not displaying on the production website (desktopcommander.app), showing 404 errors and returning as `text/html` instead of image files.

## What We Investigated

### 1. Initial State Check
- **Found:** Uncommitted changes in the repository including blog component modifications and new/deleted image files
- **Action:** Discarded all broken changes using `git restore .` and `git clean -fd`
- **Result:** Successfully restored to clean production version

### 2. Static Build Process
- Built fresh static version using `npm run build`
- Opened local preview at http://localhost:63678
- **Result:** Local version worked correctly

### 3. First Bug Discovery - Incorrect Image Filenames
- **Problem:** Blog.tsx was referencing `blog-image-1.png` through `blog-image-4.png`
- **Actual files in docs/:** `blog-1.png`, `blog-2.png`, `blog-3.png`, `blog-4.png` AND `blog-post-1.png` through `blog-post-4.png`
- **Root cause:** The code was looking for filenames that didn't exist
- **SPA server behavior:** When files don't exist, the `--single` flag causes the server to return `index.html` (as text/html with 200 status) instead of 404

### 4. First Fix Attempt - Changed to blog-post-* naming
- **Changed:** Updated Blog.tsx to use `blog-post-1.png` through `blog-post-4.png`
- **Reasoning:** These files existed in `root/public/`
- **Process followed:**
  1. Removed backup files (`blog-3.png.backup`, `blog-4.png.backup`)
  2. Committed source changes
  3. Ran `npm run commit-static` to rebuild and commit static files
  4. Pushed to production
- **Local result:** ✅ Worked perfectly
- **Production result:** ❌ Still 404 errors

### 5. Deep Investigation of Git and Deployment

#### Checked git commits
- Verified `blog-post-*.png` files were in git tree locally: ✅
- Verified files were pushed to remote: ✅
- **Discovery:** The last commit showed files renamed but NOT the blog-post versions

#### Git history analysis
```bash
git show --name-only be4be73
# Only showed: blog-1.png, blog-2.png, blog-3.png, blog-4.png
# Missing: blog-post-1.png through blog-post-4.png
```

#### File verification
- Confirmed files physically exist in `docs/` locally
- Confirmed files are tracked in git (`git ls-tree HEAD docs/`)
- Confirmed files are in remote (`git ls-tree origin/main docs/`)

### 6. Historical Context Discovery
Found previous commit (`3728f32`) with message:
> "fix: Rename blog images to blog-image-* to bypass GitHub Pages serving issue"

**Key insight:** GitHub Pages has a known issue serving certain file naming patterns!

### 7. Second Fix Attempt - Reverted to blog-image-* naming

#### Changes made:
1. Updated Blog.tsx to use `blog-image-1.png` through `blog-image-4.png`
2. Copied files in root/public: `blog-post-*.png` → `blog-image-*.png`
3. Committed source changes
4. Ran `npm run commit-static` to rebuild
5. Cleaned up backup files that got added during build
6. Pushed to production

#### Commits pushed:
- `c7d26a6` - Fix: Use blog-image-* naming to work around GitHub Pages serving issue
- `bed6ab9` - Static website changes

**Local result:** ✅ Works perfectly
**Production result:** ❌ Still not working (as of end of session)

## Technical Details

### File Structure
```

├── root/
│   ├── src/components/Blog.tsx    # React component
│   └── public/                     # Source images (copied to docs/ during build)
│       ├── blog-1.png
│       ├── blog-2.png

    ├── blog-image-2.png
    ├── blog-image-3.png
    ├── blog-image-4.png
    └── index.html
```

### Build Process
- Command: `npm run build`
- Vite copies all files from `root/public/` to `docs/`
- Special script: `npm run commit-static` handles:
  1. Removing old docs/ from git cache
  2. Running build
  3. Adding new docs/ files
  4. Committing with message "Static website changes"

### GitHub Pages Configuration
- Custom domain: desktopcommander.app
- CNAME file: Correctly set to `desktopcommander.app`
- Source: `docs/` folder on main branch
- Known issue: Some file naming patterns don't work (e.g., `blog-post-*`)

## What's Still Broken

### Production Issues
1. Blog images return 404 on desktopcommander.app
2. Network tab shows images requested with correct URLs but failing
3. Files ARE in git repository and pushed to remote
4. GitHub Pages may need more time to rebuild OR has caching issues OR has deeper serving problems

### Possible Causes (Not Yet Tested)
1. **GitHub Pages deployment delay** - May need 5-10 minutes instead of 1-2
2. **CDN/Browser caching** - Multiple browsers tested but CDN might be cached
3. **GitHub Pages file serving quirk** - Even `blog-image-*` naming might have issues
4. **Build configuration issue** - Something in Vite config or GitHub Pages settings
5. **Repository settings** - GitHub Pages might not be configured correctly
6. **CNAME/DNS issues** - Domain routing might be affecting file serving

## Files Modified in This Session

### Source Files
- `root/src/components/Blog.tsx` - Changed image references multiple times
- `root/public/blog-image-*.png` - Added these files

### Build Files  
- `docs/blog-image-*.png` - Final images in static build
- `docs/index.html` - Rebuilt with new bundle reference
- `docs/assets/main-*.js` - New bundle created

## Next Steps to Try

1. **Wait longer** - Give GitHub Pages 10-15 minutes to fully rebuild
2. **Check GitHub Actions** - Look at repository settings → Actions to see if deployment succeeded
3. **Verify GitHub Pages settings** - Repository settings → Pages → Check source and domain
4. **Try simpler naming** - Use single-letter or number-only filenames (e.g., `b1.png`, `b2.png`)
5. **Check .gitattributes** - See if there are any git settings affecting binary files
6. **Direct file access** - Try accessing https://desktopcommander.app/blog-image-1.png directly
7. **Check repository visibility** - Ensure repo is public or GitHub Pages is enabled for private
8. **Compare with working files** - Check what makes meetup-poster.png work vs blog images
9. **Rebuild without cache** - Delete docs/ entirely, rebuild fresh, commit
10. **Check for .nojekyll file** - Ensure GitHub Pages isn't processing files as Jekyll site

## Key Learnings

1. **Local ≠ Production** - Local static server works differently than GitHub Pages
2. **File naming matters** - GitHub Pages has known issues with certain naming patterns
3. **SPA mode quirk** - The `--single` flag returns index.html for missing files (200 status, not 404)
4. **Git is not the issue** - Files are correctly committed and pushed
5. **Build process works** - Vite correctly copies files from public/ to docs/
6. **Historical fixes exist** - Previous attempt (commit 3728f32) tried similar approach
